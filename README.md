# pizza-calulator
Fun &amp; and easy way to determine the number of pizzas required for any occasion.

This is really just a test to lean how to use Git / Github. But also I do want to make a simple pizza calculator, so I can practice versioning etc. with functional code.

This is another line that I added in vim. I'm also learning vim at the same time as leanring git, because why not?
